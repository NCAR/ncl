In July 2011, Fred Clare and Mary Haley had an email exchange on
what it takes to add new characters to NCL's font tables.

Fred provided some detail write-ups on what it takes to add
new characters to NCL's font tables.

The email exchange is included below, including notes on adding
an umlauted "a" to the Helvetica font (see below)

Fred,

I know we've asked this before, but how hard would it be to add a new
font table? We've gotten a trickle of requests to add accented
characters like umlauts, and I think it's becoming a pressing issue
given the globalization of our software.

Is this something that you could do for one character, and somebody
could watch over your shoulder and do the rest on their own?

I thought you had written a document on this, but I don't remember
where it is.

A complete description of the character (fontcap) tables, including
the character encodings, can be found at:

  http://ncarg.ucar.edu/supplements/cgm_supp/cgm_supp.html

If you were simply to add a character to an existing fontcap, the
information is contained in the above (but see below).  Adding a whole
new font would be beyond most people's patience, and could be beyond
me at this point.  If I were to add a new filled font, I would need an
interactive Bezier curve drawing application.  We do have a Bezier
curve generation package in $NCARG/ncarg2d/src/libncarg/support/ (the
bcxxxx routines), but of course that does not support the desired
interactive input of the control points, allowing you to move them
around to adjust the shape of a curve.  I used to use FrameMaker for
this--it had a truly elegant application for it.

As to adding characters with diacritical markings, there are several
markings you might want to consider.

For example:

umlauts  (e.g. Ä)
accent grave (e.g. É)
accent acute (e.g. È)
circumflex (e.g. Ĝ)
tilde (e.g. Ũ)
ring (e.g. Å)

And there are others.  

Taking the case of umlauts, in each of the Roman fonts you would have
to add ten new characters, one each for the upper case and lower case
characters a,e,i,o,u.  There are six filled Roman character fonts:
helvetica, helvetica-bold, times-roman, times-bold, courier,
courier-bold.  So, to add umlaut characters to the filled Roman fonts
would require adding sixty new characters.  For consistency, you would
probably want to add such characters to the stroked fonts as well:
cartographic_roman, complex_roman, duplex_roman, gothic_roman,
gothic_german.

A factor to consider is that new characters would have to be contained
in a new font table (or at least a different font table from the one
where the characters would most appropriately land) of accented
characters, since the current Roman fonts contain character entries
for all of the printable ASCII characters.

I see that the math-symbols font has nineteen places open for new
characters, so I could go through adding an ä to that font and
document what it took to do that.

Any approach I can think of other than adding accented characters at
the fontcap level has drawbacks.  For example, you could intercede at
the Plotchar function code level and perhaps implement a subroutine
such as umlaut(character).  Such a subroutine would have to inquire
about sizes, orientations, etc.  And not all characters are drawn with
Plotchar as some are ultimately drawn with the GKS GTX function.  You
could consider doing something specifically for PostScript, but
character functions specific to PostScript have run aground in the
past since that would require some ad hoc mods to Plotchar (we do have
some PostScript specific character functionality by way of GTX).

Our filled fonts have problems when displayed at small sizes.
Addressing such problems, and requests such as above, is one of the
main reasons I wanted to provide access to the fonts available through
cairo.

I have produced an example for adding an umlauted "a" to the Helvetica
font.  I have attached *detailed* notes on what is required.  This
took me about 2.5 hours, but half of that time was spent in writing
the notes.  If someone were to get underway with this, then I think an
hour per character would be a reasonable time allotment.  Would get
tedious.  Maybe a project for a student hungry for cash?  I also have
attached a sample output. I can't think of an enticement that would
get me to work on this, not even free beer for life.  I would be
willing to consult, but I think the procedure is pretty
straightforward.

Before retiring I had modified Plotchar to produce a proof of concept
for interfacing it to cairo fonts.  I recall some of the function
codes were not behaving properly, but subscripts and superscripts
were.  *Much* work (like a couple of months of dedicated time) would
need to be done on both Plotchar and the cairo driver to get this to
be a usable product where a user could plug in any TrueType font and
use it with Plotchar.  The GKS GTX function does use cairo fonts and
honors all of the GKS text attributes.  I spent untold hours getting
that working and tested.

Notes on adding an umlauted "a" to the Helvetica font.  
(see "umlaut_a.tiff" in this directory.)

  1.)  I wrote an e-mail to myself with a single unmauted "a" in it.  I
       looked at the e-mail and changed the font size of the "a" to 
       max (this was 288 for the Lucida Grand font I was using).
  2.)  In looking at the large "a", I measured on the screen the height of
       the character (13/8"), the space between the character and the
       umlaut (2/8") and the height of the umlaut (2/8").  The space
       between the two dots in the umlaut is 5/16".  The width of each
       dot in the umlaut is 2/8". The horizontal position of the
       umlaut accent is centered over the horizontal coordinate
       where the "a" achieves its maximum height.  I will use
       these proportions for the new umlauted "a" in the Helvetica font.
  3.)  The font encodings are described in the document:
       http://ncarg.ucar.edu/supplements/cgm_supp/cgm_supp.html
  4.)  I went to $NCARG/common/src/fontcap and looked at the ASCII
       fontcap for the Helvetica font (font21.fc).  I went down and
       looked at the encoding for the ASCII "a".
  5.)  Following the encoding descriptions contained in 2.), it is 
       seen that the final two numbers in the enumerated list for
       the "a" are coordinates in the font coordinate system, the
       coordinate system specified in the preamble to the fontcap.  
       Looking at those coordinates it is seen that the maximum 
       height of the "a" is 104 font coordinate units.  Note that  
       the minimum is -4, since the "a" actually goes below the base 
       line.  This is somewhat surprising, but accommodates for the 
       way that the human eye perceives characters.
  6.)  Using 104 for the height of the "a" and the proportions determined
       in step 2., the space between the bottom of an umlaut and the
       top of the "a" should be 16 coordinate units and the height of
       the umlaut accent should also be 16 coordinate units.  The 
       maximum height of the "a" occurs at horizontal coordinate 52.
       The space between the two dots of the umlaut should be 20
       font coordinate units.  
  7.)  Summarizing the details in 6.) we need to define two dots
       centered at horizontal coordinate 52 with height at the dot
       bottom 120 (104+16), dot height and width 16, and the space
       between the dots equal 20.
  8.)  Editing the ASCII fontcap in accordance with 7.) amounts to
       adding two new regions, one for each dot.  In the Helvetica
       font dots are squares (look at the dot on a "j" for example).
       In a font where a dot is not a square, it would be necessary to
       add regions, the encodings of which could be obtained
       by looking at the dot of a "j" in that font.  For diacritical
       marks other than an umlaut, try to build the accent from
       existing regions in other characters.
  9.)  Finally, here is what we need to add to the Helvetica
       fontcap.  Actually, since there is no space for a new
       character in the Helvetica font, a new font, such as
       Helvetica-accents will have to be created to hold the
       accented characters.
