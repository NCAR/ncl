      SUBROUTINE SGEFA (A,LDA,N,IPVT,INFO)
      INTEGER LDA,N,IPVT(1),INFO
      REAL A(LDA,1)
C
C     SGEFA FACTORS A REAL MATRIX BY GAUSSIAN ELIMINATION.
C
C     SGEFA IS USUALLY CALLED BY SGECO, BUT IT CAN BE CALLED
C     DIRECTLY WITH A SAVING IN TIME IF  RCOND  IS NOT NEEDED.
C     (TIME FOR SGECO) = (1 + 9/N)*(TIME FOR SGEFA) .
C
C     ON ENTRY
C
C        A       REAL(LDA, N)
C                THE MATRIX TO BE FACTORED.
C
C        LDA     INTEGER
C                THE LEADING DIMENSION OF THE ARRAY  A .
C
C        N       INTEGER
C                THE ORDER OF THE MATRIX  A .
C
C     ON RETURN
C
C        A       AN UPPER TRIANGULAR MATRIX AND THE MULTIPLIERS
C                WHICH WERE USED TO OBTAIN IT.
C                THE FACTORIZATION CAN BE WRITTEN  A = L*U  WHERE
C                L  IS A PRODUCT OF PERMUTATION AND UNIT LOWER
C                TRIANGULAR MATRICES AND  U  IS UPPER TRIANGULAR.
C
C        IPVT    INTEGER(N)
C                AN INTEGER VECTOR OF PIVOT INDICES.

C                     CONDITION FOR THIS SUBROUTINE, BUT IT DOES
C                     INDICATE THAT SGESL OR SGEDI WILL DIVIDE BY ZERO
C                     IF CALLED.  USE  RCOND  IN SGECO FOR A RELIABLE
C                     INDICATION OF SINGULARITY.
