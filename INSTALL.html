<h1>How to build NCL and NCAR Graphics V5.2.1 from source code</h1>
<p>
<i>July 11, 2010</i><p>

This is an all-encompassing document on:

<ul>

<li>How to set up your environment to build NCL and NCAR Graphics from
source code.

<li>What external software packages you need, which are optional, and
how to build them.

<li>How to build and test NCL and NCAR Graphics.
</ul>
<p>

NCL and NCAR Graphics can only be built on UNIX systems.
<p>

<blockquote>

<b>We highly recommend that you use a precompiled NCL binary rather
than attempting a build from source code.  If you tried a precompiled
binary and ran into problems, you can post your problem to
the <a href="http://mailman.ucar.edu/mailman/listinfo/ncl-install">ncl-install</a>
email list.</b>

</blockquote>
<p>

If you decide to go forth with building from source code, good luck!
<p>

<b>Note on building NCAR Graphics only:</b> you have the option during
the build process to indicate you do not want to build NCL,
effectively building just NCAR Graphics.  This simplifies the build
somewhat, since you can get by with not having to install most, if
any, of the external software packages listed below.  If you are
already familiar with building NCAR Graphics from source code, then
all the instructions you know from before are the same. The one
difference is that when you run "./Configure", be sure to answer "n"
when it asks if you want to build NCL.
<p>

Before you start building NCL/NCAR Graphics, determine what
functionality you want to include. Then read this document to see what
packages you'll need and what options they need to be built with.
Check if you already have any of these packages on your system <i>and
if they were built with the correct options</i>.
<p>

<p>

This software has been successfully built on 32 and 64 bit Linux
systems (with a variety of compilers), Macs (PPC or Intel, 32 or 64
bit) running MacOSX, IBMs running AIX, Suns, and Windows running
Cygwin (to name a few).
<p>


<a href="http://mailman.ucar.edu/mailman/listinfo/ncl-install">Email
ncl-install</a> if you have any problems understanding this document
or building any of this software.  We've included
a <A HREF="#Troubleshooting">troubleshooting</A> section for common
problems encountered when building NCL and/or NCAR Graphics.
<p>

<i>Note that in the instructions below, "NCL" will sometimes be used
to mean both NCL and NCAR Graphics. If something is for NCAR Graphics
only, we try to indicate this.</i>

<A NAME="WhatsNew"></A>
<HR>
<H2>What's new in build instructions since last NCL release</H2>
<p>

Here's what's new about the source code instructions in V5.2.1:
<p>

<ol>

<li>We highly recommend not using g77 as a Fortran compiler. Instead,
use gfortran or g95.
<p>

<li>Some external software packages have newer versions. For example,
NetCDF is at version 4.1.1 and now includes OPeNDAP software. We
highly recommend that you link against this version and not an older
version.
<p>

<li>NCL now only links against UDUNITS-2 and will not work with
UDUNITS-1.
<p>

<li>There's a new section on building <a href="#HDFEOS5">HDF-EOS 5</a>
software. This is required if you want support for reading HDF-EOS 
5 files.
<p>

<li>There's a new section on building <a href="#cairo">cairo</a>
software. This is if you want support for creating PNG output, or our
new PS/PDF output, which is in alpha test mode.
<p>

</ol>
<p>

<A NAME="SetupBuildEnvironment"></A>
<HR>
<H2>Set up and test build environment for NCL</H2>
<p>

<A NAME="CompilersNeeded"></A>
<b>Compilers needed to build NCL</b><p>

You need a Fortran 77 or 90 compiler and an ANSI C compiler to build
NCL. If your system has native Fortran and C compilers (for example
"xlf" on IBM/AIX systems), we recommend using these. In addition to
native compilers, NCL has been successfully built with a wide-range of
compilers including <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/">gcc</a>, <a
href="http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/GFortran">gfortran</a>, <a
href="http://g95.org/">g95</a>, <a
href="http://www.intel.com/cd/software/products/asmo-na/eng/282048.htm">Intel Fortran</a>
and <a
href="http://www.intel.com/cd/software/products/asmo-na/eng/284132.htm">C</a>, <a href="http://www.pgroup.com/">Portland Group</a>.
<p>

We recommend <b>not</b> using g77 as a Fortran compiler.
<p>

<A NAME="SetEnvVars"></A>
<b>Set up environment variables for external software</b><p>

Most of the external software packages that NCL and NCAR Graphics
depend on are configured using a "configure" script. These "configure"
scripts recognize a number of standard environment variables that
allow you to set compilers and compile options.
<p>

Decide what compilers and compile options you want to use, and then
set the following environment variables as appropriate:
<p>

<TABLE BORDER=1 CELLPADDING=3>

<p>


<A NAME="X11Libs"></A>
<HR>
<b>Install X11 developer libraries and include files</b><p>

In order to build some of the X applications that are part of NCL
(like <a href="http://www.ncl.ucar.edu/Document/Tools/idt.shtml">idt</a>),
you must have some of the X11 developer's libraries installed on your
system. At a minimum, you should have the following libraries (and
associated include files) installed on your system: X11, Xaw, Xext,
Xm, Xmu, Xt.
<p>

These libraries are usually installed as part of an X developer's
package, and will reside in a directory like /usr/lib, /usr/lib64,
/usr/X11R6/lib, or /usr/X11R6/lib64.<P>

For Linux systems, you can get these libraries using a command like
one of the following:

<pre>
   sudo apt-get install x11-dev
   sudo apt-get install xorg-dev
   sudo apt-get install libx11-dev
   yum install libx11-devel
</pre>
<p>

<A NAME="BuildNonOptionalSoftware"></A>
<HR>
<H2>Download and build non-optional external software</H2>
<p>

The software listed below is not optional if you plan to build NCL.
If you are building NCAR Graphics only, then read the blurb next to
each software package name to see if it is needed.
<p>

<blockquote>

<i>Once you download and install any external software to use with
NCL, you must comply with the license of that software, regardless of
what NCL's license is.</i>

</blockquote>

<p>

<b>Note:</b> it makes things easier if you install all of the external
software needed (with the exception of the X11 libraries and X11
include files) to the same parent directory.  This will be important
later when you have to tell the NCL build system where all the
external software has been installed. We will use <i>/usr/local</i> in
all of our examples below for installing external software.
<p>

<ul>

<A NAME="JPEG"></A>
<li><a href="http://www.ijg.org/">JPEG</a> - not
needed if you are only doing an NCAR Graphics build.<p>

Download version 6b (jpeg-7 supposedly has some problems)
<p>

Once you have the jpeg source code, you can build and install it
with:
<p>

<pre>
  ./configure --prefix=/usr/local
  make all install
</pre>

If you downloaded version 6b, you will additionally need to do this:
<p>

<pre>
  make install-lib
  make install-headers
</pre>
<p>

<A NAME="ZLIB"></A>
<li><a href="http://www.zlib.net/">zlib</a> - Needed if you want
<a href="#PNG">PNG</a> support in NCL/NCAR Graphics, or
<a href="#NetCDF">classic NetCDF</a> support, or <a
href="#GRIB2">GRIB2</a> support in NCL.
<p>

Download version 1.2.3 or later.
<p>

Once you have the zlib source code, you can build and install it
with:
<p>

<pre>
  ./configure --prefix=/usr/local
  make all install
</pre>
<p>

<A NAME="NetCDF"></A>
<li><a
href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/">NetCDF</a> - do
not install if you are only doing an NCAR Graphics build.
<p>

Download version 4.1.1 or later (do <b>not</b> download 4.1.0).
<p>

NetCDF versions 4 and later support both NetCDF-3 files and NetCDF-4
files.  These are different file formats. NCL supports NetCDF-3 files
and the "classic" version of NetCDF-4 files, which optionally allows
compression for potentially smaller files.
<p>

NetCDF versions 4.1.1 and later support OPenDAP, and this is built in by
default. We recommend you use V4.1.1 as 4.1.0 had a serious bug. NetCDF
4.1.x also includes the UDUNITS-2 software, but the stand-alone
UDUNITS-2 library is more up-to-date so we recommend this over the
one that comes with NetCDF. See <a href="#UDUNITS2">instructions
on building and installing UDUNITS-2</a>.
<p>

This software can be built different ways: with or without "classic"
NetCDF-4 support, and with or without OPeNDAP support. Classic
NetCDF-4 support gives you file compression capabilities, and OPeNDAP
support allows you to read NetCDF files served on the web by OPeNDAP
servers. We recommend building with both NetCDF-4 and OPeNDAP support.
<p>

Decide which version you want to build and follow one of the four set
of instructions:
<p>

<b>1. Without "classic" NetCDF-4 support, without OPeNDAP support</b><p>

<pre>
  ./configure --disable-f90 --disable-dap --prefix=/usr/local
  make all install
</pre>
<p>

<b>2. Without "classic" NetCDF-4 support, with OPeNDAP support</b><p>

<pre>
  ./configure --disable-f90 --prefix=/usr/local
  make all install
</pre>
<p>

<b>3. With "classic" NetCDF-4 support, with OPeNDAP support</b><p>

You first need to download and install the following packages:

<ul>

<LI>zlib - see <a href ="#ZLIB">instructions</a> above.
<p>

<A NAME="szip"></A>
<li><a
href="http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/release/obtain5.html">szip</a> -
Download version 2.0 or later. (Click on "External Libraries Used By HDF5".)
<p>

The szip 2.<i>x</i> software is available from same page where you
download HDF-5. Use this version, rather than the one on the official
szip page.
<p>

<pre>
  ./configure --prefix=/usr/local  --disable-shared
  make all install >& make-output
</pre>
<p>

<A NAME="HDF5"></A>
<li><a
href="http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/release/obtain5.html">HDF-5</a> -
Download version 1.8.5 or later. <b>Do not download hdf5
versions 1.8.0 through 1.8.4! Version 1.8.4-patch1 is okay.</b>
<p>

<pre>
  ./configure --with-zlib=/usr/local --with-szlib=/usr/local --prefix=/usr/local --disable-shared
  make all install >& make-output
</pre>
<p>

<A NAME="libcurl"></A>
<li><a href="http://curl.haxx.se">libcurl</a>
<p>
This software may already be on your system, so look for "libcurl*"
type of files, before you install this software yourself.
<p>

Download version 7.16.4 or later.  Once you have the source code, you can
build and install it with:
<p>

<pre>
  ./configure --prefix=/usr/local --with-zlib=/usr/local --with-pic
  make all install >& make-output
</pre>

<p>

</ul>

Then, build NetCDF as follows and be sure to include the
"--enable-netcdf-4" option:
<p>

<pre>
  ./configure --with-hdf5=/usr/local --with-zlib=/usr/local --with-szlib=/usr/local \
       --prefix=/usr/local --disable-f90 --enable-netcdf-4
  make all install >& make-output
</pre>
<p>

Note that OPeNDAP support will be built in by default. This means
that you may need the "curl" library later when building NCL. This
library may already be on your system.
<p>

<b>4. With "classic" NetCDF-4 support, without OPeNDAP support</b><p>

Follow the instructions above, but you don't need "libcurl",
and include "--disable-dap" on the above configure line for NetCDF.
<p>

<b>Troubleshooting for either NetCDF build</b>:
<p>

Note: if during the "make all install" phase of building the NetCDF
software you see an error message like:
<p>

<pre>
"cfortran.h", line 138.3: 1506-205 (S) #error cfortran.h:  Can't find your environment among:
    - MIPS cc and f77 2.0. (e.g. Silicon Graphics, DECstations, ...)
 . . .
make[3]: *** [fort-attio.lo] Error 1
</pre>

then you need to "help" the NetCDF build recognize your system by
adding the appropriate "-D" macro definition to your CPPFLAGS line.  The
error message above suggests some of them for you, or you can go to
the "<a
href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/docs/other-builds.html">Other
Builds of the NetCDF Package</a>" page for some tips.
<p>

For example, if you are on an IBM/AIX system, you might need
the "-DIBMR2Fortran" flag, and you can set it with:
<p>

[if CPPFLAGS is already set]:
<p>

<pre>
setenv CPPFLAGS  '$CPPFLAGS -DIBMR2Fortran'
</pre>

or 
<p>

<pre>
export CPPFLAGS='$CPPFLAGS -DIBMR2Fortran'
</pre>

[if CPPFLAGS is not already set]:
<p>

<pre>
setenv CPPFLAGS  -DIBMR2Fortran
</pre>

or 
<p>

<pre>
export CPPFLAGS=-DIBMR2Fortran
</pre>
<p>

<A NAME="HDF4"></A>
<li><a href="http://www.hdfgroup.org/products/hdf4/">HDF-4</a> -
if you want to build NCAR Graphics only, then HDF-4 is optional,
unless you need HDF support in <a
href="http://www.ncl.ucar.edu/Document/Tools/ctrans.shtml">ctrans</a>,
<a
href="http://www.ncl.ucar.edu/Document/Tools/ictrans.shtml">ictrans</a>,
and <a
href="http://www.ncl.ucar.edu/Document/Tools/idt.shtml">idt</a>.
<p>

Download version 4.2.5 or later. This is especially important for
MacOS 10.6 users.(HDF version 5.<i>x.y</i> is a different software
package).
<p>


<b>Important note:</b> By default, the HDF-4 include files get installed
to $prefix/include.  Since this could cause some netCDF include files
to get overwritten, you <i>must</i> use the
<b>"--includedir"</b> option to install the HDF include files instead
to <b>$prefix/include/hdf</b>.
<p>

Build and install HDF-4 with:
<p>

<pre>
 ./configure --prefix=/usr/local --with-zlib=/usr/local \
       --with-jpeg=/usr/local --includedir=/usr/local/include/hdf \
       --disable-netcdf
  make all install
</pre>

Note: if you are having problems with "make", one user reported that
he used "gmake" instead.
<p>

The paths used for the "--with-zlib" and "--with-jpeg" options must be
set to whatever you used above for these two software packages.  If
you choose to build HDF-4 with the szip compression library, be sure
to add "--with-szip=/usr/local" (or whatever location you used when
building it) to the configuration process.
<p>

</ul>
<p>

<A NAME="BuildOptionalSoftware"></A>
<HR>
<H2>Download and build optional external software, if needed</H2>
<p>

Again, as with the above section, it makes things easier if you
install all of the external software needed to the same parent
directory.  We will use <i>/usr/local</i> in all of our examples below
for installing external software.
<p>

<A NAME="GRIB2"></A>
<b>GRIB2 software</b> - not needed if you are only doing an NCAR
Graphics build.<p>

If you need support for reading <a
href="http://www.nco.ncep.noaa.gov/pmb/docs/grib2/grib2_doc.shtml">GRIB2</a>
files, then you will need to download and install the following
packages. 
<p>

<ul>

<a name="Jasper"></a> <li><a
href="http://www.ece.uvic.ca/~mdadams/jasper/">Jasper</a> - Download
version 1.900 or later.
<p>

Once you have the Jasper source code, you can build and install it
with:
<p>

<pre>
  ./configure --prefix=/usr/local
  make all install
</pre>
<p>

<li>libpng - see <a href ="#PNG">instructions</a> above.
<p>

<a name="g2clib"></a>
<li><a href="http://www.nco.ncep.noaa.gov/pmb/codes/GRIB2/">g2clib</a>
(<b>not g2lib!</b>) - There's a bug in versions 1.0.x and earlier, so
we recommend downloading 1.1.9.  Version 1.2.0 seems to have some
other bugs, so we don't recommend downloading this version.
<p>

Once you have the g2clib source code and the modified file, make
changes to "makefile" to:

<ol>

<li>change the compiler (CC line) and flags (CFLAGS lines)

<li>make sure the DEFS line has both "-DUSE_JPEG2000" and "-DUSE_PNG"

<li>if on a 64-bit system (x86_64, ia64, etc), make sure the DEFS line
also has "-D__64BIT__" (that's two underscores before and after)

<li>add the appropriate location of the Jasper/libpng include files to the
"INC" line

</ol>
<p>

Now type:
<p>

<pre>
  make all
  cp libgrib2c.a /usr/local/lib
  cp grib2.h /usr/local/include
</pre>
<p>
</ul>
<p>

<A NAME="GDAL_PROJ4"></A>
<b>GDAL/PROJ.4 software</b> - not needed if you are only doing an NCAR
Graphics build.<p>

<b>The NCL support for this software is currently in beta testing so
use at your own risk.</b>
<p>

If you need support for reading shapefile, mapinfo, TIGER, etc, file
formats, then you will need to download and install the following
two packages.
<p>

<ul>

<a name="PROJ4"></a>
<li><a href="http://trac.osgeo.org/proj/">PROJ.4</a> - Cartographic Projections
Library - Download version 4.7.0 or later.
<p>

Once you have the PROJ.4 source code, you can build and install it
with:
<p>

<pre>
  ./configure --prefix=/usr/local --enable-static=yes --enable-shared=no
  make all install
</pre>
<p>


<a name="GDAL"></a>
<li><a href="http://www.gdal.org/">GDAL</a> - Geospatial Data Abstraction
Library - Download version 1.6.0 or later.
<p>

Once you have the GDAL source code, you can build and install it
with:
<p>

<pre>
  ./configure --prefix=/usr/local --with-static-proj4=/usr/local
  make all install
</pre>

</ul>
<p>

<A NAME="HDFEOS2"></A>
<b>HDF-EOS 2 software</b> - not needed if you are only doing an NCAR
Graphics build.<p>

If you need support for
reading <a href="http://www.hdfeos.org/software/library.php#HDF-EOS2">HDF-EOS

packages:

<ul>
<li><a href="ftp://edhs1.gsfc.nasa.gov/pub/">HDF-EOS 2</a> - Download

You may need to edit the file "bin/INSTALL-HDFEOS" to make sure it
uses the correct compilers and compile options. Then run:
<p>

<pre>
  bin/INSTALL-HDFEOS
</pre>
<p>

Answer questions about location of HDF-4 lib and include files. You
must include the "hdf" subdir for the HDF4 include directory (for
example, "/usr/local/include/hdf").
<p>

Pay attention to where "libhdfeos.a" file gets installed under the
hdfeos/lib directory (for example, "hdfeos/lib/linux64"), and copy or
move this file to your library installation directory. Do the same for
the include files. Do
<b>not</b> copy libGctp.a!  For example, on a 64-bit linux machine,
you would type:
<p>

<pre>
  mv lib/linux64/libhdfeos.a /usr/local/lib/.
  cp include/*.h /usr/local/include/.
</pre>
<p>

<A NAME="gctp"></A>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

The NCL source code you download will be a single compressed tar
file (we'll call it "ncl_ncarg_src-5.2.1.tar.gz"). Move the
"ncl_ncarg_src-5.2.1.tar.gz" file to a temporary directory where you
have plenty of disk space (around 250 megabytes to hold all of the
source code, object files, binaries, and so on). Then, uncompress and
untar the file as follows:<P>

<pre>
  gunzip ncl_ncarg_src-5.2.1.tar.gz
  tar -xvf ncl_ncarg_src-5.2.1.tar
</pre>

The above steps will create a directory called "ncl_ncarg-5.2.1".  For
convenience, we'll use the notation $NCARG to mean the top level of
the NCL/NCAR Graphics source tree. Set the environment variable NCARG
to the full path of this directory.

For example, if you untarred the files from the directory
/usr/local/src, then you would do one of the following:

From tcsh or csh:
<p>

<pre>
  setenv NCARG /usr/local/src/ncl_ncarg-5.2.1
</pre>

From ksh or bash:
<p>

<pre>
  export NCARG=/usr/local/src/ncl_ncarg-5.2.1

<UL>

<A NAME="TestIfSystemRecognized"></A>
<LI><b>Test if your system is recognized by NCL build environment</b>
<p>

Before you try to build NCL, you need to quickly check if your system
will be recognized by the NCL build environment. Type:
<p>

<pre>
  cd $NCARG/config
  make -f Makefile.ini
  ./ymake -config `pwd`
</pre>
(Note that the ticks around "pwd" are back ticks.)
<p>

If no output is echoed to the screen, then this means your system is
recognized by the NCL build environment. Go to the very next section, 
"<a href="#GetConfigFileName">Get name of configuration file</a>."
<p>

If, however, you get a message:
<p>

<pre>
ymake: system unknown
</pre>

then go to <a href="#AppendixA">Appendix A</A> for information on
modifying some files in the $NCARG/config directory so they recognize
your system. Then you can come back to this section.
<p>

<A NAME="GetConfigFileName"></A>
<LI><b>Get name of configuration file</b>
<p>

If no output is echoed to the screen from the "ymake" command in the
previous section, then this most likely means that the NCL build
environment recognizes your system.  Just to be certain, you can check
the name of the configuration file that the NCL build is going to use
by typing (in the same directory):
<p>

<pre>
  grep SYSTEM_INCLUDE Makefile
</pre>

This should echo something like:
<p>

<pre>
SYSTEM_INCLUDE          = "Darwin"
</pre>

which means "Darwin" is the name of the configuration file it will
use in the $NCARG/config directory.
<p>

<A NAME="ModifySystemConfigFile"></A>
<li><b>Modify system configuration file to change default values</b>
<p>

Now that you have the name of the configuration file that's going to
be used in the "$NCARG/config" directory, you may need to edit this
file and make changes to it. The "README" in the same directory has a
description of some available configuration files that you can copy
from.
<p>

When modifying your configuration file, pay particular attention to
how the following macros are being set:<P>

<table border=1 cellpadding=5>
<tr>
<td><b>CCompiler</b>
<td>The C compiler

<tr>
<td><b>FCompiler</b>
<td>The Fortran compiler

<tr>
<td><b>CcOptions</b>
<td>C compiler options (besides the optimize flag)

<tr>
<td><b>FcOptions</b>
<td>Fortran compiler options (besides the optimize flag)

<tr>
<td><b>COptimizeFlag</b>
<td>C optimize flag(s) (the default is "-O")

<tr>
<td><b>FOptimizeFlag</b>
<td>Fortran optimize flag(s) (the default is "-O")

<tr>
<td><b>ExtraSysLibraries</b>
<td>Extra system libraries that might be needed to get
executables to link

<tr>
<td><b>CtoFLibraries</b>
<td>Extra Fortran libraries that might be needed to get
executables to link ("-lgfortran" is one example, if you
are using the gfortran Fortran compiler)

<tr>
<td><b>NgCallF</b>
<td>The macro for handling how Fortran routine names are
named in the library.

</table>

and change or add them as desired.
<p>

If you don't see these macros being defined in your system
configuration file, then that means that the default value, which is
defined in the $NCARG/config/Template file, is being used. To change
the default, just add it to your system configuration file with the
new value.<P>

For example, on Sun systems, the default "cc" compiler is used. If
you want to change this to "gcc", then modify the file
$NCARG/config/Sun4Solaris, and add the line:<P>

<PRE>
#define CCompiler  gcc
</PRE>

along with the other macro definitions.

<A NAME="BuildNCLFromSource"></A>
<HR>
<H2>Build NCL from source code</H2>
<p>

In order to build NCL from source, you must have a
Fortran 77 or 90 compiler and an ANSI C compiler. <P>

Here are the general steps for building NCL from source:

<OL>

<LI><A HREF="#RunConfigure">Run Configure script</A>

<LI><A HREF="#StartBuildAndInstall">Start the build and install process</A>

<LI><A HREF="#CheckTheInstallation">Check that the installation was
successful</A>

<LI><A HREF="#SetUpEnvironment">Set up your environment to use NCL</A>

<LI><A HREF="#TestInstallation">Test the NCL and/or NCAR Graphics
installation</A>

</OL>

<A NAME="RunConfigure"></A>
<HR>
<H2>Run Configure script</H2>
<p>

Before you build and install NCL, you need to run a script called
"Configure" to answer several questions about where you want
the software installed, what optional software you want to include,
and the location of the optional software.
<p>

Enter the following commands to run this script:
<p>

<pre>
  cd $NCARG
  ./Configure  -v
</pre>

If Configure doesn't recognize your system, it will quit right
away with an error message. Otherwise, it will start asking you
several questions.<P>

If it quits with an error message that indicates it doesn't recognize
your system, then read and follow the instructions in the section on
<a href="#TestIfSystemRecognized">Test if your system is recognized by
the NCL build environment</a> before running Configure again.
<p>

If Configure does recognize your system, then answer all of the
questions about where you want the software installed, whether you
want support for HDF4-EOS, HDF5-EOS, cairo, etc, and so on.
<p>

One of the final questions is to list the paths to your local
libraries and include files. It's important to include the paths to
the external software you want support for, like cairo, HDF-EOS5,
GRIB2, etc.
<p>

Of special importance is if you say "yes" to cairo support, then you'll
have to include the path to the freetype include files, which will
be in a directory like "/usr/local/include/freetype2".
<p>

Once you have finished running Configure, you should get a message
indicating that the configuration process is complete, and that you
can start building and installing the software.

First verify that you have the correct compilers, options, and paths
by typing:
<p>

<PRE>
    make Info
</PRE>

If everything looks okay, then you can skip the next few sections and
go directly to "<A HREF="#StartBuildAndInstall">Start the build and
install process</A>."<P>

If the installation paths look wrong, then rerun Configure and reenter
the installation paths. <P>

If something else looks wrong, like the name of the compilers or the
compiler options listed, then go back to the section "<A
HREF="#ModifySystemConfigFile">Modify system configuration file to
change default values</A>", or read the next few sections on
notes for specific systems.
<P>

<A NAME="Linux"></A>
<B>Special note for Linux systems</B><P>

The default configuration file for Linux is "LINUX". You need to
edit this file for i386, i686, x86_64, and ia64 systems. There
are several LINUX.<i>xxxx</i> sample configuration files
to help you modify this file for your purpose. Also, 
see the "README" file in the "config" directory for more information.
<p>

If you are using the "gcc" and "gfortran" compilers to build NCL, then
you will need to include something like:
<p>

<pre>
#define CtoFLibraries   -lgfortran
</pre>

in the $NCARG/config/LINUX file. You may also need to indicate
the path to the gfortran library with the -L option:
<p>

<pre>
#define CtoFLibraries -L/usr/local/lib -lgfortran
</pre>

"/usr/local/lib" is just an example. You will need to find
"libgfortran.so" or "libgfortran.a" on your system and use this path.
<p>

If you are using "gcc" and "g95" to compile NCL, then you need to do
the same thing, except use "-lf95" in place of "-lgfortran".

Ditto for if you are using the Intel compilers "icc" and "ifort", 
you may need "-lifcore".
<p>

<A NAME="MacOSX"></A>
<B>Special note for MacOSX systems</B><P>

The default file for an Intel MacOSX system is "Darwin_Intel". If
"uname -m" reports "i386" on your system, then this is the file you
want to modify.
<p>

The default configuration file for a PPC MacOSX system is "Darwin". If
"uname -m" reports "Power Macintosh", then this is the file you want
to modify.
<p>

There are are other Darwin.<i>xxxx</i> and Darwin_Intel.<i>xxxx</i>
sample configuration files. You can use any one of these
to help you modify Darwin or Darwin_Intel for your purpose.
<p>

If you have an Intel Mac running MacOS 10.6 or later, then your Mac is
probably 64-bit, and you need to copy the "Darwin_Intel.64" file to
"Darwin_Intel" and modify it as necessary.
<p>

To build NCL on an MacOSX system, you must first install a few
supplemental packages:
<p>

<OL>
<LI>MacOSX Developer Tools (Xcode)<P>
  
If you have a "/Developers/Tools" directory, cd to that directory and
search for a PDF file that will contain instructions on how to install
the Developer's Tools.<P>

Also, the xcode or the developer's tools may be on a CD that you
received with your Mac.<P>

If you don't have the directory or the CD, you can get this software
from the <A
HREF="http://connect.apple.com">http://connect.apple.com</A>
site. (You may need to create an account with them first.)  Once you
are logged in, click on "Download Software", and then "Mac OS X". You
should then see a link for downloading the Developer's Tools.<P>

<LI>fink<P>

Fink is a helpful application for MacOSX users. It's not required, but
very useful to have. In the words of the fink developers, fink "makes
existing Open Source software easily available to casual users as a
coherent, comfortable distribution that matches what Linux users are
used to".
<p>

To install fink, go to:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<A
HREF="http://fink.sourceforge.net">http://fink.sourceforge.net</A>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

and click on "Download" on the left. Follow the instructions under
"Quick Start".  Basically, you just download the binary installer that
they have a link to, and then click on the resultant
"Fink-<I>x.x.x</I>-Installer.dmg" file that should have appeared on
your Mac desktop window.  Follow the rest of the instructions to make
sure your fink environment is set up correctly.<P>

Be sure to run:
<p>

<PRE>
    fink selfupdate-cvs
</PRE>

to make sure all of the packages are up to date.<P>


<LI>GNU fortran compiler (gfortran)<P>

If you don't have a Fortran 77 or 90 compiler, then you can try
using "fink" to get one. Type something like:
<p>

<PRE>
    fink install gfortran
</PRE>

This may take awhile, if it builds the compiler from source code.
<p>

If "fink" doesn't work, then you can download precompiled MacOSX
<a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/GFortranBinaries">gfortran</a>
or <a href="http://g95.org/downloads.shtml">g95</a> binaries and
install them.
<p>

<LI>X11 server<P>

An X11 server will enable you to display NCL graphical
output to your screen. We recommend that you install Apple's X11
server, which should be on one of your installation CDs.
<p>

</OL>

NCL will build on a MacOSX system using the GNU or Absoft ProFortran
compilers.  It may not build using the Absoft XLF compilers, because
there was a problem with the way it handles the initialization of
common block routines. The problem was reported in July 2004 and may
have been fixed by now. (If this problem has been fixed and this
information is out-of-date, please email <a
href="mailto:haley@ucar.edu">Mary Haley</a> and let her know.)<P>

<A NAME="Cygwin"></A>
<B>Special note for Cygwin systems</B><P>

Before you can build any software on a Windows/Cygwin system,
you need to install a number of software packages via the "setup.exe"
X/Cygwin program. See the "<a href="http://www.ncl.ucar.edu/Download/cygwin.shtml">Installing NCL under
Windows/Cygwin/X</a> page for a full description of what you need 
and how to download it.
<p>

<A NAME="AIX"></A>
<B>Special note for AIX systems</B><P>

The configuration file for AIX is called "AIX_RS6000".  If you are
building on an AIX system in 32-bit addressing mode, then you need to
edit this file and change the appropriate options. See "AIX_RS6000.32"
for a sample.
<p>

You can also setenv the OBJECT_MODE environment variable to 64 or 32,
and this will compile everything in that mode without having to set
any compiler options. It is important that you use the same mode for
building all the external software packages as well, because
you can't mix and match 32 and 64-bit objects.
<p>

There is a "32_64" mode available, but we haven't tried this with
building NCL, and it appears to be not recommended that you do this.
<P>

<A NAME="IRIX"></A>
<B>Special note for IRIX systems</B><P>

The configuration file for SGI/IRIX is called "SGI_IRIX".  If you are
building on an IRIX system in 32-bit mode, then you need to edit this
file and change the appropriate options.  See "SGI_IRIX.n32" for a
sample.

href="http://www.ncl.ucar.edu/Download/files/NCARG_files.txt">smaller
list of NCAR Graphics files</a>.
<p>

If it looks like not all the files were installed, then take a look at
the make-output file, and check for words like "fatal" or
"error". Don't worry too much about warnings, unless they are followed
by errors.
<p>

If you find an error, try to determine the nature of the error, make
any necessary adjustments, and either start the build from scratch
or from where it left off.
<p>

If the nature of the error appears to be something like an option not
being included on every compile line, then you need to change the
system configuration file in $NCARG/config, add the necessary
option(s), and restart the build from scratch (using a different
output file):

<PRE>
    cd $NCARG
    make Everything >& make-output.2
</PRE>

If the nature of the error is such that you just need to tweak a
particular file or Makefile somewhere in the NCL/NCARG Graphics source
tree, then cd to the problem directory, make the change, and then type
the following to recompile the local change (to make sure your change
was successful) and start the build from where it left off:

<PRE>
    make me
    make includes depend all install
    cd $NCARG
    make all install >>& make-output
</PRE>

See <A HREF="#AppendixB">Appendix B</A> for more information on
editing configuration files and restarting the installation.

<A NAME="SetUpEnvironment"></A>
<HR>
<H2>Set up your environment to use NCL and/or NCAR Graphics</H2>

Once the build process is complete, you need to do the following
before you can start using NCL or NCAR Graphics:

<OL>
<LI>Set the environment variable NCARG_ROOT to the parent directory of
where you installed everything.

<LI>Make sure "$NCARG_ROOT/bin" is on your search path.

<LI>Make sure "$NCARG_ROOT/man" is on your man path.
<LI>Copy a <a href="http://www.ncl.ucar.edu/Document/Graphics/hlures.shtml">.hluresfile</a>
to your home directory (NCL only).
</OL>

Here's an example (using csh) that assumes you installed
everything to the parent directory /usr/local:<P>

<PRE>
    setenv &nbsp; NCARG_ROOT &nbsp; /usr/local<BR>
    setenv &nbsp; PATH    &nbsp; $NCARG_ROOT/bin:$PATH<BR>
    setenv &nbsp; MANPATH &nbsp; $NCARG_ROOT/man:$MANPATH
</PRE>

Here's an example for bash or ksh:

<PRE>
    export NCARG_ROOT=/usr/local<BR>
    export PATH=$NCARG_ROOT/bin:$PATH<BR>
    export MANPATH=$NCARG_ROOT/man:$MANPATH
</PRE>

</OL>
<P>

<A NAME="TestInstallation"></A>
<HR>
<H2>Test the NCL and/or NCAR Graphics installation</H2>

You can quickly test if NCL is installed properly by typing "ncl" with
the "-V" option to get the version, and then running a quick program:

<pre>
    ncl -V
    ng4ex gsun01n
</pre>

The <b>ng4ex</b> command will copy an NCL script called
<b>gsun01n.ncl</b> into your current working directory, and run it
with NCL. An X11 window should pop up with an XY plot drawn on it.
Click on this plot with your left mouse button to keep advancing to
the next frame.
<p>

Once this file is in your directory, you can also run it yourself
with:

<pre>
    ncl gsun01n.ncl
</pre>

If "ncl" seems to be working, then this indicates that your build
of NCAR Graphics was at least mostly successful, since NCL depends
on the NCAR Graphics libraries.
<p>

To test NCAR Graphics only, there's an extensive suite of examples
available. You should refer to the <I><A
HREF="http://www.ncarg.ucar.edu/fund/fundhome.html">NCAR Graphics
Fundamentals</A></I>. It will show you how to run examples and test
programs, and how to view the resulting graphics. Using the
<B>ncargex</B> and <B>ctrans</B> programs is the easiest way to test
the installation and become familiar with the use of NCAR Graphics.<P>

For a quick test, try the following:

<pre>
    ncargex cpex08
    ctrans -d X11 cpex08.ncgm
</pre>

The first command will copy a file called <B>cpex08.f</B> into your
current working directory, compile, link, and execute it, and create a
graphics file called <B>cpex08.ncgm</B>.  The second command will
display the graphic on an X11 window on your screen. You must have
your DISPLAY environment variable set correctly for this command to
work.  Left-click on the X11 window to make the graphic go away.<P>

<i>This section is for people trying to build NCL/NCAR Graphics from
source code. Many of these instructions apply to older versions of the
source code, and may not be needed for versions 5.1.x and higher.</i>

<OL>

<LI>We've had problems building some of the supplemental code (the
fontcaps, for one) for NCL using the Intel icc/ifort compilers, and
had to use gcc/gfortran instead.
<p>

If you still want to try the icc/ifort compilers, and "icc" can't find
the "ifcore" library, then you may need to include a "-L" option that
includes the path to this library in your configuration file in
$NCARG/config.
<p>

For example, if you are on a LINUX system and "libifcore.{a.so}" is
in /opt/intel/fc/10.1.013/lib, then edit $NCARG/config/LINUX and
change the CtoFLibraries line to have:

<pre>
#define CtoFLibraries   -lm -L/opt/intel/fc/10.1.013/lib -lifcore
</pre>

</pre>

then your problem may be with flex. You can try our version of
flex. Download the <a
href="http://www.ncl.ucar.edu/Download/files/flex.tar.gz">flex.tar.gz</a>
file, and then do the following to build a new flex:

<pre>
   gzcat flex.tar.gz | tar -xf -
   cd flex-2.5.3
   ./configure
</pre>
This should create a "flex" executable. Move this executable to
somewhere that's on your search path already (like maybe
$NCARG_ROOT/bin).  Make sure that you are getting this flex and not
the system one by typing:

<pre>
    rehash
    which flex
</pre>

A user reported that he had trouble compiling flex with "gcc -O2", but
that it worked with the Intel "icc" compiler, using "icc -O0 -g".  He
didn't try "gcc -O0", which you may want to try if flex is core
dumping.
<p>

Now, you can test if the "ncl" executable will build:

<pre>
   cd $NCARG/ni/src/ncl
   make clean includes depend all install
</pre>

If the file "ncl" builds, then you can start your build from where it
left off with:

<pre>
   cd $NCARG
   make all install >>& make-output &
</pre>

Of course, you can send the output from "make" to whatever file you
like.

<H1>Appendix A - Modify configuration files to recognize your system</H1>

You only need to read this section if $NCARG/ymake did not recognize
your system. (We'll refer to this as an <I>unsupported system</I>.) If
the Configure script recognized your system, then skip to the section
"<A HREF="#ModifySystemConfigFile">Modify system configuration file to
change default values</A>".<P>

The three steps you'll need to follow before building NCL on
an unsupported system are:

<OL>

<LI><A HREF="#ModifyYmakeFile">Modify the "ymake" file to recognize your system</A>.

<LI><A HREF="#SetUpConfigFile">Set up a configuration file</A>.

<LI><A HREF="#ModifyMachineDependentRoutines">Modify machine-dependent
routines</A> (if necessary).

</OL>

Once you've completed these three steps, then you need to run the
Configure script again as described in the "<A
HREF="#RunConfigure">Run Configure script</A>" section.<P>

<A NAME="ModifyYmakeFile"></A>
<B>1. Modify the "ymake" file to recognize your system</B><P>

For the first step, modify the file $NCARG/config/ymake and go
to the lines that read:<P>

<PRE>
    #   Figure out what kind of system we are on. We need to know the OS
    #   and the machine architecture.
</PRE>

Notice that the UNIX command "uname" is used to determine the
architecture type and operating system name. Once you figure out what
the various options that uname reports on your system, add your
machine architecture and operating system names to the case statements
that follow in the same manner as the other systems are done. You also
need to come up with a name for your configuration file. This is the
value you'll give to the "sysincs" variable. <A
HREF="#ExampleConfigFile">An example</A> will be provided below after
step 2.<P>

<A NAME="SetUpConfigFile"></A>
<B>2. Set up a configuration file</B><P>

For the second step, cd to $NCARG/config and prepare a configuration
file for your system that has the same name you used for the "sysincs"
variable in the ymake file. Use one of the existing configuration
files as a foundation (for example, "Sun4Solaris").  You will notice
several macros being defined in the configuration file. You only need
to define a macro if you want it to be something different than what
is defined in the "Template" file. The Template file is where all the
default values are set. For example, the default Fortran compiler is
set to "f77" in the Template file. If your Fortran compiler is called
"gfortran", then you would add the following line to your configuration
file:<P>

<PRE>
    #define    FCompiler       gfortran
</PRE>

To see what other macros are available and what the default values are
set to, see the Template file.  In particular, you may need to change
the following macros:<P>

<PRE>
    CCompiler
    FCompiler
    ExtraSysLibraries
    CcOptions
    FcOptions
    NgCallF
</PRE>
<P>

<A NAME="ExampleConfigFile"></A>
<B>Example on how to modify ymake file and set up configuration file</B><P>

As an example for the first two steps, suppose you are trying to build
a configuration file for a Koblinsky Systems Inc. SlothStation running
ChaOS version 5.4. Assume that the command "uname -s" returns "ChaOS"
and that "uname -m" returns "Sloth999". Modify the file
$NCARG/config/ymake and add:<P>

<PRE>
    case  ChaOS:
</PRE>

right after the first occurrence of the statement:<P>

<PRE>
    switch ("$foo")
</PRE>

You should now see something like:<P>

<PRE>
    switch ("$foo")
    case  ChaOS:
    case  SunOS:
    case  AIX:
    ...
</PRE>

Then, after the first occurrence of the statement:<P>

<PRE>
    switch("$opsys")
</PRE>

add the lines:<P>

<PRE>
    case  ChaOS:
        set  os      = $opsys
        set  arch    = $mach
        set  sysincs = Sloth
        set  vendor  = Koblinsky
    breaksw
</PRE>

and after the second occurrence add:<P>

<PRE>
    case  ChaOS:
</PRE>

where appropriate to get the correct major and minor operating system
version numbers defined.<P>

Let's further assume that this system is similar to a Sun workstation
running Solaris, so use the Sun4Solaris configuration file as a
foundation:<P>

<PRE>
    cd  $NCARG/config
    cp  Sun4Solaris  Sloth
</PRE>

The file name "Sloth" is used because this is the value we gave
to the "sysincs" variable above. Make any obvious changes to the file
"Sloth". As mentioned above, you may need to change the following
macros:<P>

<PRE>
    CCompiler
    FCompiler
    ExtraSysLibraries
    CcOptions
    FcOptions
    NgCallF
</PRE>

Of particular note is the "NgCallF" macro. First, a little background:
the NCL code is predominantly Fortran code, but the Fortran
code relies on a number of C support routines. Since not all systems
support the same calling conventions (for example, some systems
require an underscore after a Fortran routine name, while others
require the name to be in uppercase), the installation system is
programmed to apply the macro "NgCallF" to all Fortran-called C
code.
<p>

The default value of this macro handles the case where an underscore
is appended after the Fortran routine name, so you won't need to
define this macro if this is the behavior of your compiler. If, however,
your compiler does not append an underscore (the IBM xlf/xlf90 compilers
are two such examples), then you need to set this macro as follows:

<PRE>
    NgCallF  reg
</PRE>

If your compiler converts the Fortran routine name to uppercase (this
is the case with old Cray and the Absoft ProFortran compilers),
then you need to set the macro to: 

<PRE>
    NgCallF  caps
</PRE>
<P>

<A NAME="ModifyMachineDependentRoutines"></A>
<B>3. Modify machine-dependent routines</B><P>

There are some machine dependent routines that you may need to modify
to indicate things like the standard input/output units, the number of
bits per integer, the smallest positive magnitude, and so on. All of
these machine-dependent requirements have been isolated in several
subroutines and it may be necessary to modify these subroutines before
building the software.<P>

The routines in question are:<P>

<PRE>
    GBYTES  ISHIFT
    G01MIO  I1MACH
    IAND    R1MACH
    IOR     SBYTES
</PRE>

These routines are referred to as "low-level support routines" in the
remainder of this section. Complete functional descriptions for these
routines appear in the section "<A
HREF="#MachineDependentRoutines">Machine-dependent support
routines</A>". Examples of implementations of all of these subroutines
except G01MIO are given in the directory:<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>
$NCARG/common/src/libncarg_c
</B>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

A Fortran implementation of the support routine G01MIO is contained in
the directory:<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>
$NCARG/ncarg2d/src/libncarg_gks/bwi
</B>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

G01MIO is the basic I/O routine for NCAR's GKS package, and it is not
used anywhere else but in that package.<P>

The subroutines in the above two directories are examples only. These
examples may help you, and some may actually run on your machine, but
care must be taken to ensure that the implemented routines satisfy the
functional descriptions as given in the "<A
HREF="#MachineDependentRoutines">Machine-dependent support
routines</A>" section. Some of the examples given are coded in C.<P>

There is source code for creating an executable for testing
implementations of the low-level routines in the directory:<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>
$NCARG/ncarg2d/src/bin/impltest
</B>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

The source in this directory may require changes only when
moving to a machine with a word size other than 32 or 64.<P>

This directory contains a program called "tlocal" that can be
used to test the implementations of IOR, IAND, ISHIFT, GBYTES, and
SBYTES. Read the prologue documentation in the code for tlocal
for implementation instructions. Success or failure messages will be
issued to Fortran unit 6. There are no tests for I1MACH and R1MACH,
but the success of the tlocal test depends on proper
implementation of I1MACH and R1MACH. Constants for I1MACH and R1MACH
for a large number of computers appear in the comment cards of I1MACH
and R1MACH. If constants for your host computer appear there, simply
uncomment the appropriate cards for your implementation of I1MACH and
R1MACH. Otherwise be very careful to implement I1MACH and R1MACH
correctly since there is no test for them. The support routine G01MIO
is used only by NCAR's GKS package, and no test for it is provided in
tlocal.<P>

Since many of the low-level support routines are executed frequently
throughout the package, efficient versions are desirable. There are
portable Fortran versions of GBYTES and SBYTES in the directory:<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>
$NCARG/common/src/libncarg_c
</B>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

but they run very slowly. GBYTES and SBYTES are used primarily in the
NCGM translator; machine-language versions of these routines could
greatly speed up the translator. Machine-language versions of IAND,
IOR, and ISHIFT are also desirable.

<A NAME="AppendixB"></A>
<H1>Appendix B - General information on build process</H1>

This section contains general information on building NCL
that you may find useful.  It includes information on:

<LI><A HREF="#ConfigurationFiles">configuration files</A>

<LI><A HREF="#RestartingInstallation">how to restart the

<A NAME="ConfigurationFiles"></A>
<H3>Configuration files</H3>

Configuration files contain make macros. At installation time, these
macros are used by ymake to construct all of the Makefiles for
building NCL and NCAR Graphics.  Any change you make in your
configuration file will cause a change in your Makefile(s), if you run
something like "make Everything", "make Makefiles", or "make me" to
regenerate the Makefile(s). Refer to the "<A HREF="#ymake">ymake</A>"
section for more information.<P>

Configuration files reside in the directory $NCARG/config. They have
names like "Sun4Solaris" and "SGI_IRIX" to indicate the machine on
which they operate. For example, If you are on a Sun running Solaris,
you should make changes to the file $NCARG/config/SunSolaris. See the
"README" file in this directory for more information about the various
configuration files.<P>

A few of the macros are quite likely to change from system to system,
but most are not. The Configure script allows the installer to
make some of these minor changes to the configuration file without
editing it. You must be running csh in order to run
Configure.<P>

<A NAME="RestartingInstallation"></A>
<H3>Restarting the installation</H3>

The standard build process is initiated by telling make to build the
"Everything" target, which results in a series of actions. First, a
hierarchy of Makefiles is constructed, based on your system
configuration. Next, all old object code is removed, dependencies are
created, and then compilation, the most time-consuming step,
begins. Finally, libraries and executables are built and then
installed. This can take from thirty minutes to a few hours. If you
encounter an error along the way, it is very important that you avoid
wasting the work that has already been done. There are other targets
besides "Everything". The following targets may be used to gracefully
restart the installation process:<P>

<PRE>
    Everything = (Makefiles, clean, all, install)
    All        = (Makefiles, all, install)
    all        = (compile and build libraries)
    install    = (move objects to destinations)
    clean      = (remove object files, core dumps, etc.)
</PRE>

If a compilation fails halfway through the install process and you
have already created the Makefiles, cleaned out old object code, and
compiled a large number of files, you may first correct the problem and
then restart the install process.

To correct the problem, you need to first look carefully at the error
message in the make-output file.  By looking at the last several lines
of the make-output file, you should be able to determine which
directory the make stopped in.  For example, let's say see the
following in your make-output file:

<PRE>
...
Making ./ncarview/src/lib/libncarg_ras

"hdf.c", line 192: cannot recover from previous errors
cc: acomp failed for hdf.c
*** Error code 2
make: Fatal error: Command failed for target `hdf.o'
</PRE>

You can see from the:

<PRE>
    Making ./ncarview/src/lib/libncarg_ras
</PRE>

line that the make bombed in the directory
"ncarview/src/lib/libncarg_ras". The error message here indicates that
it can't find the HDF include files.  To fix this problem, then, you
would need to do one of three things:

<OL>

<LI>Install HDF on your system (see the section <A
HREF="#GetHDF">"Download the source code or binaries for HDF"</A>),
and then also follow step #2.

<LI>If HDF is already installed on your system, run "Configure" and
include the paths to HDF when it asks for local library and
include directory search paths.

<LI>Run "Configure" and answer <B>no</B> to the question: "Build HDF
support into raster library?".

</OL>

In most cases, the fix just involves modifying source files and
recompiling. If this is the case, then after you fix the source
file(s), you can restart the install process by typing:

<PRE>
    cd $NCARG
    make all install >& make-output &
</PRE>

In our example above with the HDF software, the fix involved something
that would affect the Makefiles.  In this case, then, you need to
regenerate the Makefiles. To do this, type:<P>

<PRE>
    cd $NCARG
    make All >& make-output &
</PRE>
<P>

<A NAME="ymake"></A>
<H3>ymake</H3>

A utility named "ymake" is used by this package to generate the
Makefile hierarchy.<P>

A file named yMakefile exists in each directory and is
converted to a regular Makefile using the C preprocessor and a
collection of general and system-specific macros. The ymake
system resides in $NCARG/config. This allows the redundant
information in each Makefile to be isolated, in addition to
providing Makefile conditionals. The C preprocessor knows what
system it is running on. (The same technique is being employed in
other systems, including MIT's X Window System.)  If you need to
change a Makefile, implement the changes in the
yMakefile and then type:<P>

<PRE>
    make me
</PRE>

If you completely destroy a Makefile, you can usually recover
by typing:<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>
$NCARG/config/ymkmf

There is more information about ymake in the ymake man
page which resides in the directory $NCARG/config.

<H3>Machine-dependent support routines</H3>

Following are functional descriptions of the required

<B>FUNCTION ISHIFT(IWORD,N)<P></B><P>

IWORD is shifted by N bits. If N > 0, a left circular shift is
performed (all bits are shifted left N bits, and the bits that are
shifted out of the word to the left are shifted back into the word at
the right). If N < 0, a right end-off shift is performed (all bits are
shifted right by N bits, and the bits that are shifted out of the
right of the word are lost)-if the leftmost bit is 0, then the vacated
positions are filled with zeros; if the leftmost bit is 1, then the
vacated positions are undefined.  The implementor may assume that
IABS(N) .LE. word_length.<P>

<B>FUNCTION IAND(K1,K2)</B><P>

The bit-by-bit logical product of K1 and K2. If K3 = IAND(K1,K2), then
the nth bit of K3 is 0 if the nth bit of either K1 or K2 is 0;
otherwise the nth bit of K3 is 1.  FUNCTION IOR(K1,K2) The bit-by-bit
logical sum of K1 and K2. If K3 = IOR(K1,K2), then the nth bit of K3
is 0 if and only if the nth bit of both K1 and K2 is 0.<P>

<B>SUBROUTINE G01MIO(IOP,IUNIT,FNAME,IBUFF,LENGTH,IERROR)</B><P>

This output routine is the central one for the metafile generator. A
Fortran implementation of this subroutine is in the directory:<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>$NCARG/ncarg2d/src/libncarg_gks/bwi</B>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Input arguments</B><P>

<DL>

<DT>IOP
<DD>Indicates type of operation desired: IOP = 1 means OPEN workstation for 
output on IABS(IUNIT). IOP = 2 means CLOSE workstation for output on 
IABS(IUNIT). IOP = 3 means write IBUF to IABS(IUNIT). IOP = 4 means read 
IABS(IUNIT) into IBUF. IOP = 5 means position the record pointer to the 
beginning of the file. IOP = 6 means position the record pointer to the 
beginning of the previous record.

<DT>IUNIT
<DD>IABS(IUNIT) is the Fortran logical unit number on which IOP is to occur. 

<DT>FNAME
<DD>The filename to be used for the open operation. 

<DT>IBUFF
<DD>Buffer containing data for a read or write operation.

<DT>LENGTH
<DD>Length of data in IBUFF, in integer words.

</DL>

<B>Output arguments</B><P>

<DL>

<DT>IERROR
<DD>Error indicator that equals 0 if no errors.
</DL>

<B>SUBROUTINE GBYTES(NPACK,ISAM,IBIT,NBITS,NSKIP,ITER)</B><P>

This subroutine is used to unpack bit chunks from NPACK into the ISAM
array. A portable Fortran version of this routine is distributed, but
the Fortran version is inefficient and should be replaced with a more
efficient implementation.<P>

<DL>

<DT>NPACK
<DD>Address of first word of the array to be unpacked. For the
purposes of this subroutine, NPACK is viewed as a bit stream.

<DT>ISAM
<DD>Array to receive the unpacked bit chunks. They will be right
justified with zero-fill in this array. ISAM should be dimensioned for
ITER.

<DT>IBIT
<DD>A bit-count offset to be used before the first bit chunk is
unpacked. For example, if IBIT=3, and NBITS=5, then 3 bits in NPACK
will be skipped and the next 5 bits will be unpacked into ISAM(1).

<DT>NBITS

<DD>The number of bits in each bit chunk to be unpacked. An error
condition occurs if NBITS is larger than the number of bits-per-word
on the machine.

<DT>NSKIP
<DD>The number of bits to skip between each bit chunk to be
unpacked. Bits are skipped only after the first bit chunk has been
unpacked.

<DT>ITER
<DD>The number of bit chunks to be unpacked.
</DL>

For example:<P>

<PRE>
       CALL GBYTES(NPB,ISB,3,6,9,2)
</PRE>

In this call, three bits would be skipped at the beginning of NPB; the
next six bits would be unpacked into ISB(1) and right-justified with
zero-fill; nine bits would be skipped in NPB, and then the next six
bits of NPB would be unpacked into ISB(2) and right-justified with
zero-fill.<P>

<B>SUBROUTINE SBYTES(NPACK,ISAM,IBIT,NBITS,NSKIP,ITER)</B><P>

This subroutine is the reverse of GBYTES as described above.
NPACK-Address of first word of array to be packed.  ISAM-Array to be
packed into NPACK. The rightmost NBITS bits of each word will be
packed. ISAM should be dimensioned for at least ITER.  IBIT-A
bit-count offset to be used before the first bits are packed into
NPACK.

For example, if IBIT=3, and NBITS=5, 3 bits in NPACK will be skipped
before the rightmost 5 bits of ISAM(1) are packed into it.  NBITS-The
number of bits in each word of ISAM to be unpacked. An error condition
occurs if NBITS exceeds the word size on the machine.  NSKIP-The
number of bits to skip between each bit chunk packed.  ITER-The number
of bit chunks to be packed.<P>

For example:<P>

<PRE>
       CALL SBYTES(NPC,ISB,45,6,3,2)
</PRE>

In this call, 45 bits would be skipped at the beginning of NPC; the
rightmost 6 bits of ISB(1) would be packed into NPC; 3 bits would be
skipped in NPC, and the rightmost 6 bits of ISB(2) would be packed
into NPC.<P>
